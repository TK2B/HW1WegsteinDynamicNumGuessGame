- Just inital commit in progress 

open qestions:

- how to use styles on elements created within the code (i have no idea why the global theme isn´t working) or how to force Android to use the theme ? 

- not sure why it shows the title twice on an alertmesseage ? 



Homework 1: DynamicNumGuessGame App
The purpose of this assignment is to enhance the AdvancedNumGuessGame by giving the user the ability to adjust the complexity of the game. The games complexity in this case is defined by the number of numbers shown on the screen (anywhere between 2 and 9) and the number range from which the program randomly chooses the numbers displayed on the buttons.
The user should see a first screen where he/she enters their name, the number of buttons to be displayed and the range from which the numbers are randomly chosen from. Once the user hits the “Play Game” button, the screen switches to a new screen that displays the buttons, the score and the timer.
The user can press an “End Game” button at any time. In that case a new screen is shown which presents the final score, the number of right/wrong picks (if one runs out of time, that’s considered a wrong answer) and the time the user played the game.
Assignment Description:
Starting-point: Use the code from your first assignment AdvancedNumGuessGame as your starting point. Enhance this app by adding the required functionality as described above.
The grid for your buttons will depend on the number of buttons displayed. We suggest you work with LinearLayouts (both horizontal and vertical) to arrange the buttons accordingly. No more than three buttons should go in row (horizontally).
Constraints: Again, we’ll leave things very open-ended. I’ll leave it up to you to design the screen and make it look nice.
• Name your app “HW1<Lastname>DynamicNumGuessGame” (so if I were to submit a solution, I’d call my app HW1NaurothDynamicNumGuessGame). Along with your app, please turn in a file named README.txt that contains your name and email address along with the name of your app and a very brief description of it, along with any special instructions that the user might need to know in order to use it properly (if there are any). For example:
Joe Student jstudent@siue.edu
DynamicNumGuessGame - This app shows two numbers on the screen and asks the user to pick the larger number. Perfect for talented students! Note: Runs best on big Android tablets because of 1000dp font choice.
Suggestions:
Again, bear in mind that these assignments, as well as this class in general, are meant to be low- stress and fun. Feel free to make an app as simple or as complex as you like, relative to your familiarity level and time constraints. In case you run into major obstacles, always feel free to contact Josh or myself.
Turn-in and Grading:
Once done, please upload your code (preferably the zip-file extracted from Android Studio) into Blackboard/OLAT. After programs are turned in, you will be asked to peer-evaluate another student's submission. Details will be provided in class.

Your submission will be graded quickly by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive credit. Your code will not be graded on style, but we still encourage you to follow good overall coding style for your own sake.
